Wish/task list
-really could use ice!

-dispensors-syringes, steppers, frame, esthetics
-electronics for dispensors - arduino(s), stepper drivers, limit switches
--big issue: code that talks bartendro protocol...
-nice to have: 3 color LED's matching bartendro dispensor.
-server - Raspberry pi
-server software - bartendro ui code

-Server side: 'games' do something to earn your drink.

what is options.turbo_mode to the console? index line 39

Overview:

-use bartendro web ui. Extend it, and give back, with 'entertaining' 
features.
-adapt, if needed, bartendro firmware, 
Next Things.

-software: I think I can clone x, y, z to u, v, w, x, y, z for six, 
or more, stpper motor control...so 'C-Gode' (Cocktail code)
G0 U1 V1 W1 X1 Y1 Z1
or
G1 U1 V2 W3 X2 Y1 Z1
Would dispense them all to finish at the same time...

Or...
G0 U nn
where nn = quantity in milliliters. Sure...turns per milliliter is 
logical.

Or just restart the paradigm at 'A.'

G1 A30 B15 C15
Would be a white russian if...
A = Vodka
B = Kahlua
C = Cream

In a 2:1:1 ratio

Or maybe adapt the existing bartendro code...



Need 1/8" tubing at some point.
-1/8" Y fittings are ordered. 

Luer Lock Fittings are awesome.

Figuring out modular units of 60 cc and 20 cc syringes, and steppers.
3 steppers fit in a 2" x 6" piece of Aluminum Bar. And 3 20 cc syringes
work fine.

But 60 ml syringes don't quiet fit.

Maybe make 3" x 6" bar for 2 60ml syringes, with matching stepper mounts.

2 1/2" bar would probably work. But nothing will work perfectly...something
gets compromised.

The existing 2" x 6" 3 stepper and 3 20 ml syringe mounts look like they 
will work perfectly. Yay.

But they are tight when using the stop cocks...so maybe more breathing
room is good for everying.

Put the existing parts into a something, but make 3" wide parts moving 
forward? Or 2" and 3" but with 2 syringes rather than 3?

The new pistonbot...

Wow, meeting Robert the helicopter pilot is all the win!

Luer Lock syringes and tubing and fittings!

Stop cocks, with a servo to flip them? instead of 
check valves, or Solenoid valves?


http://www.thepulsar.be/article/adding-an-actuated-flow-selector-valve-to-our-syringe-pump/


Summary of the world...

Tasks...
-figure out frame which holds one stepper, the makerbeam to plunger,
the plunger guides, and the syringe.

-motor mount
-motor to all thread coupler
-partial tap of gridbeam
-clearance drill the rest of the gridbeam
-syringe plunger to gridbeam coupling
-gridbeam alignment rollers/bearings - three of them
-possible plate for the alignment rollers to connect to the vertical
-hold plunger to frame - 'broom' holder? and slot to hold the top in place?
or L brackets with a cut out - see sketches
-Check valves or stop cocks? if stop cocks need to fit servos.
(I have stop cocks and check valves coming)
-tubing...I probably need to figure out my size, I hope it is 1/8"
and get some...

Which size syringe? probably bigger...

Electronics:
one arduino and stepper board give me control of five stepper valves. 

Display? Thinking probably a tablet. And a web interface.

lights...magic shifters on special arms?
Sound/music.  Almost mandatory to have sound.

think about using bartendro code. Why not?

....
Bartendro related thoughts.
At what level do I want to make my hardware act like a bartendro?

-I could make syringe units to emulate bartendro dispensors.
pro: all other bartendro code would work without change
con: sort of a PITA





look at cable car controls

bartendro.db - it is an sqlite3 database. So, nifty.

Some motors are better than others. Whoops.

about 2.7" = full 20cc
1.35" for 10cc

1/4-20 lead screw. 
turns per cc?
20turns/1inch * 1.35 inches / 10 cc

2.7 turns per cc?2

now ~7 seconds for 15 cc of the smaller syringe 
It is moving about 1.9" in 7 seconds.
That would be closer to 27 cc with the larger syringe.
So...the better part of 30 seconds for a large drink if the 
dispensing is serial.

But we can probable have paerallel dispensing.
yes...it looks like parallel works.

To speed up:
-different lead screws? This is 1/4-20. 

'All screw mechanisms have a critical velocity — the rotational velocity limit of the screw after which vibrations develop due to the shaft’s natural harmonic frequency. This is also commonly called “screw whip"
